# Netflix-Themed Portfolio Website
A responsive portfolio website that recreates Netflix's UI/UX design, presenting professional experience as streaming content with interactive animations and smooth transitions.

## Overview
This portfolio reimagines the traditional resume as a Netflix interface where work experience becomes "episodes," projects are "trending content," and skills are organized as curated categories. The implementation leverages modern web technologies to create an immersive, familiar interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Full-viewport billboard with parallax scrolling and Netflix Original branding
- **Project Carousels**: Horizontally-scrollable cards with signature zoom-on-hover effects
- **Smooth Navigation**: Sticky header with scroll-triggered transparency transitions
- **Interactive Elements**: 3D card tilt effects, typing animations, and ripple click feedback

## Design Implementation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting all viewport sizes
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML5 structure with proper navigation

## Technical Stack
- HTML5 for semantic markup
- CSS3 for animations and responsive layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
- CSS Variables for dynamic theming
